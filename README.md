# MikeCamp
[YelpCamp](https://mike-camp.herokuapp.com) is a directory of free bush camping sites I've stayed at in Australia.
It was built as the 'YelpCamp' final project from The Web Developer Bootcamp (Colt Steele/Udemy)

YelpCamp is a full-stack app incorporating:

**Technologies:**
nodejs, mongo database, express, passport, bootstrap, mongoose, ejs templates, connect-flash, font-awesome, git

**Features:**
Authorisation, authentication, login/signup, comments, add/edit/delete, RESTful routes, partials, middleware
More features still to come

[Deployed](https://mike-camp.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku and [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
